}


=item my $uuid = $sec->get_uuid()

Returns a 16 byte long string containing the raw globally unique identifier
(UUID) for the secret.

=item my $uuid = $sec->get_uuid_string()

Returns a printable string representation of the raw UUID, in the format
'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'.

=item my $type = $sec->get_usage_type()

Returns the usage type of this secret. The usage type determines the
format of the unique identifier for this secret.

=item my $id = $sec->get_usage_id()

Returns the identifier of the object with which the secret is to
be used. For secrets with a usage type of volume, the identifier
is the fully qualfied path.

=item my $xml = $sec->get_xml_description()

Returns an XML document containing a complete description of
the secret's configuration

=item $sec->undefine()

Remove the configuration associated with a secret previously defined
with the C<define_secret> method in L<Sys::Virt>.

=item $bytes = $sec->get_value()

Returns the raw bytes for the value of this secret, or undef if
there is no value stored with the secret.

=item $sec->set_value($bytes)

Sets the value for the secret to be C<$bytes>.

=head1 CONSTANTS

This section documents constants that are used with various
APIs described above

=head2 SECRET USAGE TYPE

The following constants refer to the different usage types

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_NONE

The constant for secrets which are not assigned for use with a
particular object

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_VOLUME

The constant for secrets which are to be used for storage
volume encryption. The usage ID for secrets will refer to
the fully qualified volume path.

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_CEPH

The constant for secrets which are to be used for authenticating
to CEPH storage volumes. The usage ID for secrets will refer to
the server name.

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_ISCSI

The constant for secrets which are to be used for authenticating
to iSCSI storage volumes. The usage ID for secrets will refer to
the server name.

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_TLS

The constant for secrets which are to be used for authenticating
for the TLS environment. The usage ID for the secret can be any
name. The UUID for the secret will be used by the hypervisor to
fetch the secret value.

=back

=head2 LIST FILTERING

The following constants are used to filter object lists

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_EPHEMERAL

Include any secrets marked as ephemeral

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_NO_EPHEMERAL

Include any secrets not marked as ephemeral

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_PRIVATE

Include any secrets marked as private

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_NO_PRIVATE

Include any secrets not marked as private

=back

=head2 EVENT ID CONSTANTS

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE

Secret lifecycle events

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::EVENT_ID_VALUE_CHANGED

Secret value change events

=back

=head2 LIFECYCLE CHANGE EVENTS

The following constants allow secret lifecycle change events to be
interpreted. The events contain both a state change, and a
reason though the reason is currently unused.

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::EVENT_DEFINED

Indicates that a persistent configuration has been defined for
the secret.

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::EVENT_UNDEFINED

The persistent configuration has gone away
