}


=item my $uuid = $sec->get_uuid()

Returns a 16 byte long string containing the raw globally unique identifier
(UUID) for the secret.

=item my $uuid = $sec->get_uuid_string()

Returns a printable string representation of the raw UUID, in the format
'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'.

=item my $type = $sec->get_usage_type()

Returns the usage type of this secret. The usage type determines the
format of the unique identifier for this secret.

=item my $id = $sec->get_usage_id()

Returns the identifier of the object with which the secret is to
be used. For secrets with a usage type of volume, the identifier
is the fully qualfied path.

=item my $xml = $sec->get_xml_description()

Returns an XML document containing a complete description of
the secret's configuration

=item $sec->undefine()

Remove the configuration associated with a secret previously defined
with the C<define_secret> method in L<Sys::Virt>.

=item $bytes = $sec->get_value()

Returns the raw bytes for the value of this secret, or undef if
there is no value stored with the secret.

=item $sec->set_value($bytes)

Sets the value for the secret to be C<$bytes>.

=head1 CONSTANTS

This section documents constants that are used with various
APIs described above

=head2 SECRET USAGE TYPE

The following constants refer to the different usage types

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_NONE

The constant for secrets which are not assigned for use with a
particular object

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_VOLUME

The constant for secrets which are to be used for storage
volume encryption. The usage ID for secrets will refer to
the fully qualified volume path.

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::USAGE_TYPE_CEPH

The constant for secrets which are to be used for authenticating
to CEPH storage volumes. The usage ID for secrets will refer to
the server name.

=head2 LIST FILTERING

The following constants are used to filter object lists

=over 4

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_EPHEMERAL

Include any secrets marked as ephemeral

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_NO_EPHEMERAL

Include any secrets not marked as ephemeral

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_PRIVATE

Include any secrets marked as private

=item Sys::Virt::Secret::LIST_NO_PRIVATE

Include any secrets not marked as private
