=head1 NAME

Sys::Virt::NodeDevice - Represent & manage a libvirt storage pool

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Sys::Virt::NodeDevice> module represents a storage pool managed
by libvirt. There are a variety of storage pool implementations for
LVM, Local directories/filesystems, network filesystems, disk
partitioning, iSCSI, and SCSI.

}


=item my $name = $dev->get_name()

Returns a string with a locally unique name of the device

=item my $parentname = $dev->get_parent()

Returns a string with a locally unique name of the parent
of the device, or undef if there is no parent

=item my $xml = $dev->get_xml_description()

Returns an XML document containing a complete description of
the storage dev's configuration

=item $dev->reattach()

Rebind the node device to the host OS device drivers.

=item $dev->dettach()

Unbind the node device from the host OS device driver

=item $dev->reset()

Reset the node device. The device must be unbound from the host
OS drivers for this to work

=item $dev->destroy()

Destroy the virtual device releasing any OS resources associated
with it.

=item my @caps = $dev->list_capabilities()

Return a list of all capabilities in the device.
