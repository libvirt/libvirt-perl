=head1 NAME

Sys::Virt::NodeDevice - Represent & manage a libvirt storage pool

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Sys::Virt::NodeDevice> module represents a storage pool managed
by libvirt. There are a variety of storage pool implementations for
LVM, Local directories/filesystems, network filesystems, disk
partitioning, iSCSI, and SCSI.

=item my $name = $dev->get_name()

Returns a string with a locally unique name of the device

=item my $parentname = $dev->get_parent()

Returns a string with a locally unique name of the parent
of the device, or undef if there is no parent

=item my $xml = $dev->get_xml_description()

Returns an XML document containing a complete description of
the storage dev's configuration

=item $dev->reattach()

Rebind the node device to the host OS device drivers.

=item $dev->dettach()

Unbind the node device from the host OS device driver

=item $dev->reset()

Reset the node device. The device must be unbound from the host
OS drivers for this to work

=item $dev->create($flags=0)

Start a node device whose configuration was previously defined using the
C<define_node_device> method in L<Sys::Virt>. The C<$flags> parameter is
currently unused and defaults to zero.

=item $dev->undefine($flags=0)

Delete a node device whose configuration was previously defined using the
C<define_node_device> method in L<Sys::Virt>. The C<$flags> parameter is
currently unused and defaults to zero.

=item $flag = $dev->get_autostart();

Return a true value if the node device is configured to automatically
start upon boot. Return false, otherwise

=item $dev->set_autostart($flag)

Set the state of the autostart flag, which determines whether the
node device will automatically start upon boot of the host OS.

=item $dev->is_active()

Returns a true value if the node device is currently running

=item $dev->is_persistent()

Returns a true value if the node device has a persistent configuration
file defined

=item $dev->destroy()

Destroy the virtual device releasing any OS resources associated
with it.

=item my @caps = $dev->list_capabilities()

Return a list of all capabilities in the device.

=item $dev->update($xml, $flags=0)

Update the definition of an existing node device with C<$xml>. The
C<$flags> parameter can be use to control which config is affected
(see XML UPDATE FLAGS) and defaults to zero (affect current state of
the node device).
