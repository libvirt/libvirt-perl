   Sys::Virt Installation
   ======================

Sys::Virt requires that libvirt already be installed on the
system. The libvirt libraries and header files are located using
the pkg-config database. If libvirt is installed to a prefix
other than /usr, then be sure to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable before building this module:

  $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/some/prefix/lib/pkgconfig

Then follow the standard procedure for a Module::Build based
installation:

  $ perl Build.PL
  $ ./Build
  $ ./Build test
  $ sudo ./Build install

-- End
