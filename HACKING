   Hacking on libvirt perl
   =======================

The libvirt Perl release versions are tied directly to the libvirt C
library release versions. ie Sys::Virt 1.2.10 will require libvirt
version 1.2.10 or newer in order to build. We do not aim to support
conditional compilation against versions of libvirt that are older
than the version of Sys::Virt.


General changes for new APIs
----------------------------

Additions to the libvirt C API will require changes to a minimum
of two parts of the Sys::Virt codebase.

 - Virt.xs - this provides the C glue code to access the libvirt C
   library APIs and constants from the Perl interpretor. As a general
   rule, every new function and header file constant/enum requires an
   addition to this file.  The exceptions are functions that are only
   provided for the benefit of language bindings and not intended for
   use by application code. For example the reference counting APIs
   don't need exposing to Perl applications

 - lib/ - this directory contains the pure Perl part of the binding.
   There are separate files for each core libvirt object type

     - lib/Sys/Virt.pm - mapping for virConnectPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Domain.pm - mapping for virDomainPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Error.pm - mapping for virErrorPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Event.pm - mapping for virEventPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Interface.pm - mapping for virInterfacePtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Network.pm - mapping for virNetworkPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/NodeDevice.pm - mapping for virNodeDevicePtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/NWFilter.pm - mapping for virNWFilterPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Secret.pm - mapping for virSecretPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/StoragePool.pm - mapping for virStoragePoolPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/StorageVol.pm - mapping for virStorageVolPtr
     - lib/Sys/Virt/Stream.pm - mapping for virStreamPtr

   There is rarely a need to write Perl code in the .pm modules, as
   the mapping in the Virt.xs file is usually sufficient. As such
   the primary purpose of the .pm modules is to hold the POD inline
   documentation. Every function and constants is required to have
   full API documentation provided

There are a number of unit tests available in the t/ directory which
assist in creation of new APIs.

 - t/010-pod-coverage.t - ensures that every Perl method and constant
   has POD documentation present
 - t/030-api-coverage.t - ensures that every C library method/constant
   in the libvirt-api.xml file has corresponding code in the Virt.xs.
   Certain functions can be blacklisted in t/030-api-coverage.t as not
   needed mapping to Perl. This only runs if TEST_MAINTAINER=1 is set.
 - t/*.t - the other files mostly do functional testing against the
   test:///default API - if the new function has support in the test
   driver, then suitable additions should be made

If use of the API is not obvious, it is often worth providing a small
example program in the examples/ directory. These examples are also
useful when adding APIs to ensure that they are operating correctly,
if it wasn't possible to unit test them with test:///default.

Every addition / change to the API must be documented in the Changes
file.


New API addition workflow
-------------------------

When the libvirt C library is changed, the following workflow is an
effective way to update the Perl binding.

 - Build the libvirt C library

    # cd $HOME/src/libvirt
    # ./autogen.sh --system
    # make

 - Configure & build the Sys::Virt module to build against the just
   built libvirt library

    # cd $HOME/src/libvirt-perl
    # ../libvirt/run perl Makefile.PL
    # ../libvirt/run make

 - Run the test suite to identify which new functions/constants need
   handling

    # ../libvirt/run make test TEST_MAINTAINER=1

 - For each missing item reported in the test suite...

     - Edit Virt.xs to add the C binding
     - Edit lib/*.pm to add the POD documentation (and occassionally Perl glue code)
     - Edit Changes to document the addition
     - Run the test suite (without maintainer mode) to verify POD docs
         # ../libvirt/run make test
     - Optionally add to one of the t/*.t test cases
     - Optionally add demo to examples/
     - Commit the changes to GIT


Understanding Virt.xs glue layer
--------------------------------

The Perl XS glue (Virt.xs) is a pretty bizarre language, that mostly
looks like C but is actually run through a Perl specific preprocessor
to turn it into real C code. Learning and understanding XS code well
is a really difficult task, but fortunately such knowledge is rarely
required in order to add new APIs to the Perl Sys::Virt code.

When adding constants just look for the REGISTER_CONSTANT() macro
at the end of Virt.xs. Make sure that the constant is registered against
the correct Sys::Virt::XXXX object namespace - look for the adjacent
'gv_stashpv' calls to see which namespace is currently in effect.

When adding methods, you must again make sure they are put in the
correct object namespace. For methods, look for the statements
that look like:

   MODULE = Sys::Virt::NWFilter  PACKAGE = Sys::Virt::NWFilter

these indicate the start of a namespace for the object in question.
When implementing the binding for a method, if not already familiar
with XS code, the best technique is to just do cut+paste programming.
Find an existing libvirt API call that has the same kind of API
signature as the new API. Then just copy the XS code for that method
and tweak the parameter names as needed.

Async event callbacks have a little bit of special handling too. The
callbacks are all implemented as static methods at the very top of
the Virt.XS file. Look for method names like _domain_event_pmsuspend_callback
and just copy the code for an existing callback method that has a similar
set of parameters to the new callback.

Once the callback is implemented look for the domain_event_register_any()
or network_event_register_any() methods and extend the switch() statement
so that it maps the event ID constant to your new callback.


Making new releases
-------------------

The Sys::Virt releases are hosted on the Perl project CPAN infrastructure
rather than libvirt.org

 1. Build the new release of libvirt as an RPM and install it on the
    local machine.

 2. Set the release date in the Changes file and commit the change

 3. Tag the release with a GPG signed tag using vX.Y.Z syntax for
    the tag name

     git tag -s -m 'Release 1.2.14' v1.2.14

 4. Clone the repository or run 'git clean -x -f -d' to ensure a
    100% pristine state

 5. Run autobuild.sh to test the full test suite and generate local
    RPMs. This results in Sys-Virt-1.2.14.tar.gz file being created

 6. Take the src.rpm file that was just generated by autobuild.sh
    and run a scratch build against Fedora rawhide

      # cd $HOME/src/fedora/perl-Sys-Virt
      # fedpkg scratch-build --srpm /path/to/src/rpm/file

 7. Push the Changes commit and tag to GIT master

      # git push
      # git push origin v1.2.14

If there is a failure at any step then this must be corrected
as follows

  a. Delete the signed release tag

       git tag -d v1.2.14

  b. Fix whatever the problem was and update the Changes file
     if appropriate

  c. Go to release process step 3 again.


Assuming the release has now been made, the Sys-Virt-1.2.14.tar.gz
file should be uploaded to CPAN using https://pause.cpan.org form.
The upload is currently done by Daniel Berrange (username DANBERR).

Now open the tree for the next release version by editing the files
lib/Sys/Virt.pm, README, Makefile.PL to update the version number
listed. Also edit Changes to add a placeholder entry for the new
release number. Run 'make test' to ensure Changes file is syntax
valid.
